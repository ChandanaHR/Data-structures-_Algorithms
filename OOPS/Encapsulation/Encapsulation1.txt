/* Encapsulation - Wrapping up of data, variables, methods into single unit. Some professionals refer this as "data hiding".
Encapsulation hides the class variables from other classes. These class variables can be accessed only through the methods of the
current class, and cannot be accessed by the methods of other class leading to data hiding*/
